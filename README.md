"Elevens"
================

## Introduction
This is an implementation of the "Elevens" solitare game. Elevens is a patience or card solitaire of the Simple Addition family that uses a standard 52-card deck, with the goal of removing pairs of cards that add to eleven. Odds of winning are slightly better than 1 in 10. This project focuses on shuffeling the deck. 

The included DeckTester.java file, provides a basic set of Deck tests.
